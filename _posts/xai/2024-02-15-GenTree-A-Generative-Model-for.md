<br><br>Abstract. Decision trees are among the most popular supervised models due to their interpretability and knowledge representation resembling human reasoning. Commonly-used decision tree induction algorithms are based on greedy top-down strategies. Although these approaches are known to be an efficient heuristic, the resulting trees are only locally optimal and tend to have overly complex structures. Â On the other hand, optimal decision tree algorithms attempt to create an entire decision tree at once to achieve global optimality.<br><br>We place our proposal between these approaches by designing a generative model for decision trees. Our method first learns a latent decision tree space through a variational architecture using pre-trained decision tree models. Then, it adopts a genetic procedure to explore such latent space to find a compact decision tree with good predictive performance. We compare our proposal against classical tree induction methods, optimal approaches, and ensemble models. <br><br>The results show that our proposal can generate accurate and shallow, i.e., interpretable, decision trees.<br><br><br>___<br><br>Microsoft Teams meeting<br>Join on your computer, mobile app or room device<br><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a511689e6d6494b2c95e95fe823c57aae%40thread.tacv2/1706633728751?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c7456b31-a220-47f5-be52-473828670aa1%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22729b4d16-0567-46a8-a742-d2ae1bf09a4a%22%7d" target="_blank"><u>Click here to join the meeting</u></a><br>Meeting ID: 367 203 176 108 <br>Passcode: 7pb7m3
