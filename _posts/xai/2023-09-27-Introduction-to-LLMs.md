<b>Abstract:</b> Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are ubiquitous. In this talk, we will discuss LLMs, which have recently been the driving force behind a number of advances in artificial intelligence. This will cover some of the most well-known LLMs now available as well as the basic concepts underpinning LLMs, their general architecture, and some of their key features.
