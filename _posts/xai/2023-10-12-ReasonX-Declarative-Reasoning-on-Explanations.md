Stream details below.<p><p><strong>Abstract.<strong> Explaining opaque Machine Learning ML models is an increasingly relevant problem. Current explanation in AI XAI methods suffer several shortcomings, among others an insufficient incorporation of background knowledge, and a lack of abstraction and interactivity with the user. We propose REASONX, an explanation method based on Constraint Logic Programming CLP. REASONX can provide declarative, interactive explanations for decision trees, which can be the ML models under analysis or globallocal surrogate models of any blackbox model. Users can express background or common sense knowledge using linear constraints and MILP optimization over features of factual and contrastive instances, and interact with the answer constraints at different levels of abstraction through constraint projection. We present here the architecture of REASONX, which consists of a Python layer, closer to the user, and a CLP layer. REASONXs core execution engine is a Prolog metaprogram with declarative semantics in terms of logic theories.<p><br><p><p><p>Microsoft Teams meeting<p><br><br><b><p><strong>Join on your computer, mobile app or room device<strong><p><b><p><a hrefhttps:teams.microsoft.comlmeetupjoin193a9a85abed0d8544a8bc86e6f8f42e599d40thread.tacv21696432157078context7b22Tid223a22c7456b31a22047f5be52473828670aa1222c22Oid223a22729b4d16056746a8a742d2ae1bf09a4a227d><u>Click here to join the meeting<u><a><p><br><br><p>Meeting ID: 341 121 035 466 <p><p> <p><p>Passcode: BHbWct <p>
