@article{diagnostics14070753,
 abstract = {A crucial challenge in critical settings like medical diagnosis is making deep learning models used in decision-making systems interpretable. Efforts in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are underway to address this challenge. Yet, many XAI methods are evaluated on broad classifiers and fail to address complex, real-world issues, such as medical diagnosis. In our study, we focus on enhancing user trust and confidence in automated AI decision-making systems, particularly for diagnosing skin lesions, by tailoring an XAI method to explain an AI model’s ability to identify various skin lesion types. We generate explanations using synthetic images of skin lesions as examples and counterexamples, offering a method for practitioners to pinpoint the critical features influencing the classification outcome. A validation survey involving domain experts, novices, and laypersons has demonstrated that explanations increase trust and confidence in the automated decision system. Furthermore, our exploration of the model’s latent space reveals clear separations among the most common skin lesion classes, a distinction that likely arises from the unique characteristics of each class and could assist in correcting frequent misdiagnoses by human professionals.},

 abstract = {The rise of sophisticated machine learning models has brought accurate but obscure decision systems, which hide their logic, thus undermining transparency, trust, and the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in socially sensitive and safety-critical contexts. We introduce a local rule-based explanation method, providing faithful explanations of the decision made by a black box classifier on a specific instance. The proposed method first learns an interpretable, local classifier on a synthetic neighborhood of the instance under investigation, generated by a genetic algorithm. Then, it derives from the interpretable classifier an explanation consisting of a decision rule, explaining the factual reasons of the decision, and a set of counterfactuals, suggesting the changes in the instance features that would lead to a different outcome. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of the quality of the explanations and of the accuracy in mimicking the black box.},

 abstract = {The varied backgrounds and experiences of human annotators inject different opinions and potential biases into the data, inevitably leading to disagreements. Yet, traditional aggregation methods fail to capture individual judgments since they rely on the notion of a single ground truth. Our aim is to review prior contributions to pinpoint the shortcomings that might cause stereotypical content generation. As a preliminary study, our purpose is to investigate state-of-the-art approaches, primarily focusing on the following two research directions. First, we investigate how adding subjectivity aspects to LLMs might guarantee diversity. We then look into the alignment between humans and LLMs and discuss how to measure it. Considering existing gaps, our review explores possible methods to mitigate the perpetuation of biases targeting specific communities. However, we recognize the potential risk of disseminating sensitive information due to the utilization of socio-demographic data in the training process. These considerations underscore the inclusion of diverse perspectives while taking into account the critical importance of implementing robust safeguards to protect individuals{'} privacy and prevent the inadvertent propagation of sensitive information.},

 abstract = {Selective classification (or classification with a reject option) pairs a classifier with a selection function to determine whether or not a prediction should be accepted. This framework trades off coverage (probability of accepting a prediction) with predictive performance, typically measured by distributive loss functions. In many application scenarios, such as credit scoring, performance is instead measured by ranking metrics, such as the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). We propose a model-agnostic approach to associate a selection function to a given probabilistic binary classifier. The approach is specifically targeted at optimizing the AUC. We provide both theoretical justifications and a novel algorithm, called AUCROSS, to achieve such a goal. Experiments show that our method succeeds in trading-off coverage for AUC, improving over existing selective classification methods targeted at optimizing accuracy.},

This brought the widespread deployment of these methods in many fields, intending to support decision-making. A pressing question is how to make AI systems robust to common challenges in real-life scenarios and trustworthy. In my work, I plan to explore ways to enhance the trustworthiness of AI through the selective classification framework. In this setting, the AI system can refrain from predicting whenever it is not confident enough, allowing it to trade off coverage, i.e. the percentage of instances that receive a prediction, for performance.},
